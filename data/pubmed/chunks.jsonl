BACKGROUND Subglottic stenosis (SGS) is a life-threatening airway narrowing often acquired after prolonged intubation in infants. Although severe cases have historically required open surgery, emerging endoscopic techniques such as laser therapy, balloon dilation, and cryotherapy provide less invasive alternatives with promising outcomes. This case report describes a 2-month-old female infant who developed subglottic stenosis after intubation and mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure due to pertussis pneumonia. CASE REPORT A 2-month-old female infant with a history of pertussis pneumonia requiring 10 days of intubation presented with respiratory distress and stridor. Diagnostic imaging and flexible laryngoscopy confirmed grade 3 SGS (Cotton-Myer classification). She underwent a multimodal endoscopic approach, including holmium laser ablation (0.5-1.0 J/pulse) for fibrotic tissue removal, balloon dilation (6 mm, 14 atmospheres) to expand the stenotic segment, and cryotherapy (-70°C) to minimize scar formation. Immediate post-procedural improvement was observed, and oxygen was gradually tapered by day 5. Follow-up fiber laryngoscopy at 1 month demonstrated sustained airway patency without restenosis. CONCLUSIONS This case supports the efficacy of combined endoscopic modalities for severe pediatric SGS, offering advantages over open surgery, including reduced morbidity and faster recovery. Long-term studies are needed to confirm durability, particularly for high-grade stenosis. Standardized protocols for laser settings, balloon sizing, and cryotherapy duration should be established to optimize outcomes."}

In living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT), significant donor-recipient age differences often occur because of the limited pool of related donors, typically parents or children, raising concerns regarding whether this affects postoperative outcomes and survival. In this study, we assessed the effect of living-donor and recipient age mismatch on LDLLT outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included 82 patients who underwent bilateral LDLLT and 164 donors between October 1998 and October 2023. The donor-recipient pairs were categorized into three groups: an age difference of ≥ 20 years for both lungs, ≥20 years for one lung, and <20 years for both lungs. Postoperative outcomes, including survival and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD)-free survival, were compared between groups. There were no significant differences in perioperative outcomes, including hospital mortality, 1-year survival, and acute rejection rates, across the different age-mismatch groups. Additionally, there was no clear correlation between age difference and the development of CLAD. Overall and CLAD-free survival rates were similar among the three groups, suggesting that donor-recipient age mismatch does not adversely affect long-term outcomes. Within the limitations of this single-center, retrospective cohort, we did not detect a significant association between donor-recipient age difference and perioperative, overall, or CLAD-free survival outcomes in LDLLT."}

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of nosocomial infections, bacteremia, and worldwide mortality. Further, a drastic rise in antibiotic-resistant isolates poses an urgent threat to humanity. Unfortunately, despite its clinical importance, a licensed K. pneumoniae vaccine is not yet available. Here, we report on the production and characterization of the broadest K. pneumoniae capsule bioconjugate vaccine to date. We tested this vaccine for its immunogenicity, functionality, efficacy, and antibody durability against a variety of K. pneumoniae isolates in a murine bacteremia model. We also established an immunocompromised murine model of bacteremia to better recapitulate human infection and tested our vaccine's efficacy in this background. The tetravalent capsule vaccine is highly immunogenic in mice, generating a robust immune response against all capsule types included (K1, K2, KL102, and KL107). Further, the generated antibodies persist for at least 6 months. The vaccine-induced antibodies are highly functional against a variety of clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae, including both classical and hypervirulent strains. Finally, the vaccine led to increased survival after bacteremia challenge compared to placebo-immunized mice. Our findings confirm that a capsule-based bioconjugate vaccine has clinical potential in preventing K. pneumoniae infections. These experiments signify much-needed progress towards a multivalent vaccine to combat this increasingly troublesome pathogen."}

Esophagorespiratory fistulae are rare pathological communications between the esophagus and the respiratory tract. While acquired bronchoesophageal fistulae have been sporadically documented in dogs, tracheoesophageal fistulae, particularly in the cervical region, are exceptionally rare. This case report is the first to describe an acquired cervical tracheoesophageal fistula in a dog following esophageal foreign body retention. The case highlights the clinical course, diagnostic challenges, and successful surgical management, expanding the current understanding of this uncommon condition in veterinary medicine. A 6.5-year-old male Shih Tzu was referred for persistent hyporexia, vomiting, and moist cough following endoscopic removal of a bone lodged at the thoracic inlet. Despite medical management for esophagitis and aspiration pneumonia, the dog exhibited progressive respiratory signs and recurrent pneumonia. An esophagorespiratory fistula was suspected based on the ability to provoke coughing by liquid ingestion and tracheal palpation. Endoscopic examination confirmed a defect in the esophageal wall with direct communication to the tracheal lumen, consistent with a cervical tracheoesophageal fistula. Surgical repair was performed via a cervical ventral midline approach, involving separate closure of the tracheal and esophageal defects and reinforcement using a bipedicle sternohyoid muscle flap. Recovery was uneventful, and the dog remains asymptomatic at 12-month follow-up. This case underscores the importance of considering a tracheoesophageal fistula in dogs presenting with persistent or recurrent gastrorespiratory signs following esophageal foreign body removal. Diagnosis can be challenging due to the rarity of the condition and its non-specific clinical presentation. Endoscopy proved to be a safe and effective diagnostic tool and avoided the risk of aspiration associated with contrast studies. The surgical technique, including muscle flap interposition, mirrors approaches used in human medicine, where similar strategies are applied to prevent recurrence. Comparative insights with human cases highlight the translational value of interspecies knowledge, especially in understanding pathogenesis, refining diagnostics, and optimizing treatment. Continued reporting and awareness of tracheoesophageal fistula in veterinary patients are essential to improve outcomes and explore minimally invasive alternatives."}

In addition, close human-animal interactions and unregulated antibiotic use in livestock facilitate the spread of resistant bacteria. We use metagenomic sequence data and multivariate models to assess how animal exposure and WASH conditions affect the gut resistome and microbiome in 53 pregnant women and 84 children in Ecuador. Here we show improving WASH infrastructure and managing animal exposure may be important in reducing AMR but could also reduce taxonomic diversity in the gut. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are detected across all age groups, but the highest abundance is found in children compared to mothers. In mothers, higher animal exposure trends towards a higher number of unique ARGs compared to low animal exposure and is significantly associated with greater taxonomic diversity. In addition, mothers with sewer systems or septic tanks and piped drinking water have fewer unique ARGs compared to those without, and mothers with longer duration of drinking water access have lower total ARG abundance. In contrast, few associations are observed in children, likely due to the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome during early childhood."}

Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (CR-HvKP) is a growing public health threat due to its virulence and limited treatment options. While prevalent in hospitals, its presence in livestock, particularly pigs, is poorly understood. The gut microbiome provides colonization resistance, but how it restricts CR-HvKP remains unclear. To further elucidate the colonization resistance mechanisms of the gut microbiota against CR-HvKP, we analyzed stool samples from piglets (L), nursery (N), fattening (F), and sows (PS) using microbiome modeling (Micolo) and competition assays. ST290 K. pneumoniae isolated from PS inhibited CR-HvKP via carbohydrate competition, with a pronounced effect observed for sucrose. Niche-specific supplementation with methyl pyruvate was found to partially alleviate this ecological inhibitory effect. Carbohydrate-based interventions could be explored as potential therapeutic or prophylactic strategies to combat CR-HvKP colonization, thereby potentially improving animal and public health outcomes.

Acinetobacter baumannii is the primary cause of persistent opportunistic infections in healthcare settings, recognized as a global priority due to its resistance to antibiotic therapy. Quorum sensing and biofilm formation are the key factors driving the pathogenesis and drug resistance of A. baumannii. Nanostructures demonstrated encouraging promise in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and overcoming treatment failure. Therefore, the efficacy of staphyloxanthin (STX)-encapsulated niosomes was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The formulated niosomal nanovesicles displayed a spherical shape at the nanoscale (177.8 nm), featuring a slow-release rate (39.6%) and appropriate entrapment efficiency (92.7%). Our results demonstrated that STX exhibited strong antibacterial activity, with MIC values up to 16 µg/mL against multidrug-resistant isolates (n = 24). The in vitro findings revealed that the encapsulation of STX within niosomal nanovesicles demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy compared to the free solution. This improvement was reflected by a significant reduction in biofilm formation (68-88%), motility (66.66-94.45%), and siderophore production (48.75-79.5%), as well as marked disruption of the mature biofilm by 82%. The anti-quorum sensing activity of STX was further confirmed the attenuation of biofilm and virulence, as evidenced by downregulation of abaI expression (1.42-fold reduction) and molecular docking simulations. It is noteworthy that the biological findings revealed a significant eradication of meropenem-induced persister cells after the addition of niosomal dispersion. The preclinical investigations prove the efficacy of STX in improving survival rates through reducing the bacterial burden (2-fold reduction) and lethal inflammatory consequences in a mouse model of pneumonia. our results suggested that STX may serve as a promising alternative for combating A. baumannii biofilms and persister cells."}

Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is an emerging pathogen capable of causing lethal metastatic infections in healthy individuals. While liver abscesses are well-described, the urinary tract is increasingly recognized as a primary portal for hematogenous dissemination. A 46-year-old man with previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus presented with community-acquired urinary tract infection (CA-UTI) that rapidly progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness and meningitis. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified K. pneumoniae harboring hypervirulence genes rmpA and iucA. Blood, urine, and CSF cultures yielded an ESBL-negative, pansensitive hvKP strain. Brain MRI revealed septic emboli, consistent with hematogenous dissemination. This case highlights the urinary tract as an underrecognized but lethal source of hvKP dissemination, particularly in diabetic patients. The rapid neurologic decline and permanent deafness highlight the need for early recognition and aggressive management. Virulence gene profiling should complement routine susceptibility testing. mNGS enabled rapid pathogen identification and guided targeted therapy.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a life-threatening syndrome of acute hepatic decompensation (AD) that leads to multiorgan failure and high mortality. Bacterial infections are often implicated in ACLF pathogenesis; however, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study employed a combined in vitro-ex vivo metabolomics approach to investigate infection-associated metabolic alterations relevant to ACLF. Gut (Caco-2) cells were infected with Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Metabolite profiling was conducted on cell culture supernatants, and selected metabolites were tested for hepatotoxicity in vitro using liver (HepG2) cells. Metabolomic analysis of sera from two independent patient cohorts (AD and ACLF) was conducted to validate in vitro findings and to assess their clinical relevance. Distinct metabolic signatures were identified in A. baumannii (19 metabolites) and K. pneumoniae (15 metabolites)-infected Caco-2 cells. Four key metabolites from each bacterial species were prioritized for further experiments: α-ketoglutarate, indoleacetic acid, p-coumaric acid, uridine (A. baumannii), desthiobiotin, N8-acetylspermidine, N-acetylglutamine, and β-pinene (K. pneumoniae). Hepatotoxicity was demonstrated in liver (HepG2) cells exposed to Caco-2 infected cell-derived supernatants, infection-associated metabolites, and metabolite mixtures (in all conditions, P<.0001).

However, the association between standardized respiratory reactance (Xrs) measured by oscillometry and clinical outcomes in IIPs, including those other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated this association. We retrospectively analyzed 101 patients with fibrotic IIPs treated at Shizuoka General Hospital from 2017 to 2022. Fibrosis was defined by high-resolution computed tomography findings of honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, or subpleural reticulation. Patients were categorized into high-Xrs or low-Xrs groups based on whether Xrs parameters (X5, Fres, or AX) exceeded 1.64 standard deviations above Japanese standard values. The primary outcome was mortality. Cox proportional hazards analysis identified prognostic factors. Among 101 patients, 25 (24.8 %) were classified as high-Xrs. Median overall survival was significantly shorter in the high-Xrs group (21.1 months; 95 % CI, 13.2-43.3) compared to the low-Xrs group (78.7 months; 95 % CI, 56.8-not reached).

Antimicrobial resistance represents one of the most pressing global health challenges of the 21st century, significantly compromising the efficacy of conventional antibiotics. In response to this crisis, the World Health Organization has updated its 2024 list of priority bacterial pathogens-classified into critical-, high-, and medium-risk groups-based on their resistance mechanisms, clinical impact, and global dissemination. This comprehensive review explores the emerging therapeutic potential of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) when used in synergistic combinations with conventional antibiotics. By dissecting the mechanistic interplay-ranging from membrane disruption and efflux pump inhibition to biofilm penetration and intracellular antibiotic delivery-we provide a structured analysis of how these dual strategies overcome specific resistance barriers. Special emphasis is given to the World Health Organization-designated pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant/vancomycin-resistant), Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Supported by extensive in vitro and in vivo data, this review catalogs dozens of successful AMP-antibiotic pairings, highlighting their fractional inhibitory concentration indices, clinical relevance, and implications for translational development. The evidence presented demonstrates that AMPs not only potentiate antibiotic action but also extend the useful lifespan of existing drugs while reducing toxicity. These findings support the advancement of AMP-based combination therapies as a next-generation strategy to contain resistance and restore the effectiveness of the antimicrobial arsenal. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Antimicrobial resistance remains a global health emergency, especially among World Health Organization 2024 priority pathogens. This review highlights the therapeutic promise of synergistic combinations between antimicrobial peptides and conventional antibiotics, offering a rational strategy to restore efficacy, overcome resistance mechanisms, and extend the clinical utility of existing drugs.

COVID-19 infection is associated with negative health impacts and death, as well as increased healthcare resource use, direct medical costs, and indirect cost burdens. Treatment with antivirals, such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r), have been shown to help reduce costs following COVID-19 infection by preventing hospitalization.

Data that met the inclusion criteria were extracted for treatment delivered between August 2022 and October 2024. Paired t-tests were used to examine whether there were significant improvements between pre- and post-treatment outcome measures. For people with Long Covid that completed treatment (n = 31), three t-tests were completed showing a significant reduction from PCE-CfD treatment, in depression (p < 0.01), anxiety (p < 0.01) and social functioning (p < 0.05). Cohen's d values indicated a very large effect size for a treatment effect in the reduction of depression (d = 2.1) and anxiety symptoms (d = 1.2). Recovery rates were analysed, using the NHS Talking Therapy recovery rate calculation, which showed that 83.87% of the people with Long Covid who were treated reached 'recovery', a much higher rate than the 48% NHS England target. This NHS service evaluation underscores the effectiveness of PCE-CfD in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improving social and occupational functioning. These improvements observed in routine outcome measures highlight the benefits of offering a humanistic approach to people with Long Covid."}

Beef tripe is a traditional delicacy in Botswana and many African communities. Despite its popularity and nutritional value, tripe remains highly perishable and prone to microbial contamination due to its origin in the bovine gastrointestinal system and potential exposure during processing. This study assessed the microbial quality of beef tripe samples collected from 18 butcheries in Gaborone, Botswana, including both microbial enumeration and species-level identification. The results revealed a high microbial load across all samples, with aerobic plate counts exceeding 5 log CFU/g in some cases. Total coliforms, including Escherichia coli, were also prevalent. Molecular identification using 16S rRNA gene sequencing uncovered a diverse bacterial community dominated by Aeromonas veronii (8.25%), E. coli (13.54%), Klebsiella pneumonia (8.25%) and Kurthia gibsonii (10.31%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant intra-genus diversity, further supported by in silico restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. The presence of potential pathogens and spoilage organisms, even in refrigerated samples, underscores the need for stringent hygienic handling and public education on proper preparation. The findings provide baseline microbial profiles for tripe in Botswana and stress the importance of integrating molecular diagnostics into routine food safety monitoring."}

Using full-spectrum multi-parametric flow cytometry, we assessed the distribution of co-signaling molecules on the surface of NK cells, both without and with stimulation with tuberculosis-specific antigens ESAT6 and CFP10. 7 inhibitory receptors, and 6 co-stimulatory receptors were analyzed. The proportion of NK cells was significantly higher in the LTBI individuals compared to HC (P = 0.0199) and TB patients (P = 0.0027). In the absence of tuberculosis-specific antigen stimulation, the expression of TIGIT and TIM-3 were higher in the LTBI group compared to the TB group (P = 0.0128, P = 0.0340). The expression of CD160 in the TB group was significantly lower than in the HC and LTBI individuals (P = 0.0042, P = 0.0124). Upon stimulation with tuberculosis-specific antigens, the expression of OX40 was markedly elevated in LTBI and TB compared to HC (LTBI vs. HC, P = 0.0031; TB vs. HC, P = 0.0493), and the expression of CRTAM in the TB group was obviously higher than in HC (P = 0.0192). Expression of co-signaling molecules on NK cells, including TIGIT, TIM-3, CD160, OX40, and CRTAM, was altered following TB infection.

Advances in biotechnology have allowed for production of virtually any functional protein or peptide in the human body through the introduction of various classes of RNA, including regulatory and coding RNAs (e.g., mRNA) in the form of linear or circular RNA (circRNA). To be effective, nucleic acid therapeutics require safe, stable, and efficient delivery vehicles that protect the otherwise labile cargo from degradation, promote cellular uptake, and facilitate payload release. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have enjoyed recent clinical success for the delivery of mRNA to combat disease - especially against coronavirus 2019 (SARS CoV-2) and, more recently, against high-grade ductal breast carcinoma (clinical trial) - marking significant milestones for RNA nanomedicines. As an alternative to LNPs and mammalian viral vectors, we report the use of nucleoprotein components from a filamentous plant virus, potato virus X (PVX) as an RNA platform delivery technology. Designer nucleoprotein complexes of filamentous and halo-shaped nanoparticles were obtained through self-assembled templating on custom mRNAs and circRNAs. The flexuous nature of the PVX platform enabled the packing of circRNA yielding a unique nanoparticle platform. We explored assembly from coat protein (CP) obtained from PVX particles produced in planta but also extended the design space by producing recombinant CP by bacterial expression. Controlled mixed assemblies were achieved allowing the programming of mosaic particles with integrated functionality; length control was also demonstrated, resulting in bespoke nucleic acid delivery vehicles for tunable pharmacology.

Proteus vulgaris is a Gram-negative opportunistic bacterium implicated in wound infections, urinary tract infections, foodborne illnesses, pneumonia and septicemia. It poses a growing threat to human, veterinary and aquaculture health systems. In animals, P. vulgaris has been isolated from cattle, poultry, and pets, while in fish species such as Nile tilapia and Clarias gariepinus, it contributes to ulcerative and systemic diseases. Its frequent detection in raw milk, meat, and retail fish highlights its zoonotic potential. The rise of multidrug-resistant strains across clinical, veterinary, and food sectors underscores the urgent need for alternative control strategies. This study employed reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics to identify potential vaccine targets against P. vulgaris. Candidate proteins were screened based on subcellular localization, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, similarity to human proteins, B- and T-cell epitope binding, immune simulation results, conservation analysis and key physicochemical properties. Seven promising vaccine candidates were identified: Cytochrome bd-I oxidase subunit CydX (A0A094UCZ6), TatA translocase (A0A379F7E9), cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunit IV (KGA56684), hydrogenase maturation factor (A0A379F868), bacteriophage Rz lysis family protein (KGA60362), a lipoprotein (A0A379F4X1) and a hypothetical protein (A0A379F5R5). These targets exhibited strong immunogenic potential, as indicated by immune simulation graphs showing pronounced IFN-γ responses and IgG production. The study supports vaccine development as a viable strategy to combat multidrug-resistant P. vulgaris across species.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Veterans Health Administration hospitals in the continental United States with emergency departments between 1 March 2019 and 28 February 2023. We included Veterans who were discharged from an acute medicine service without a COVID-19 diagnosis. We used standardized utilization management criteria to count 'avoidable' days, defined as hospital days when acute care was no longer required. Our primary outcome was geometric mean length of the discharging stay (the final acute medicine segment prior to discharge), which reflects the time most susceptible to discharge delays. During the study period there were 868,031 eligible hospitalizations. Adjusted geometric mean length of discharging stay increased 9.3% (95% CI, 8.7% to 9.9%) from the pre-pandemic year to the third pandemic year, with the largest increase among discharges to facility-based post-acute care (23.3% [95% CI, 21.6 to 24.9%]). However, among all hospitalizations only 16% (95% CI, 15 to 17%) of the increase in discharging stay was attributable to an increase in avoidable days. Most of the increase in length of hospital discharging stay was not explained by discharge delays and may instead reflect longer periods of acute care delivery. Improving acute care processes may more effectively reduce hospital capacity strain than bolstering post-acute care availability."}

Solid organ transplant recipients were among the most vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chronic immunosuppression and multiple comorbidities greatly increase the risk of severe illness and death. Despite global advances in vaccination and treatment, practical tools for early risk assessment in this group are still limited. This study aims to address this gap by identifying simple, widely available laboratory markers that can be used upon hospital admission to predict short-term outcomes in COVID-19 patients with a history of organ transplantation. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of solid organ transplant recipients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection at the University Clinical Center in Gdańsk, Poland, between 2020 and 2022. Patients were admitted to either a general COVID-19 ward or an intensive care unit based on disease severity. Data were collected from electronic medical records and included demographic characteristics, chest imaging, and routine laboratory tests: lymphocyte count, serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the association of these variables with in-hospital mortality. Our analysis identified that elevated levels of serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were significantly associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Conversely, a higher lymphocyte count at admission was associated with better survival. These markers are widely available, inexpensive, and can be assessed during the initial diagnostic workup. This study offers a practical, evidence-based approach to early risk stratification in transplant recipients with COVID-19. The identified laboratory markers are not only simple and accessible but also clinically meaningful, providing frontline clinicians with actionable information during the early stages of care.

Bacterial meningitis remains a significant global health concern, particularly in resource-limited settings where patients often present late and have co-existing conditions. This study aimed to identify the common bacterial pathogens causing meningitis, assess their antibiotic resistance profiles, and evaluate treatment outcomes in suspected meningitis patients. We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study involving 195 patients suspected of meningitis at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected and analyzed using both culture and PCR for bacterial etiology. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined via the disc diffusion method. Treatment outcomes were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. We used descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multivariable analysis to identify factors associated with unfavorable patient outcomes, with statistical significance set at a p-value < 0.05 at a 95% confidence level. The prevalence of bacterial meningitis, confirmed by either culture or PCR, was 28.2% (55/195). Among the 55 detected bacterial etiologies, E. coli was the most common (45.5%, n = 25), followed by H. influenzae (16.4%, n = 9), S. pneumoniae (10.9%, n = 6), N. meningitidis (7.3%, n = 4), S. aureus (5.5%, n = 3), S. agalactiae (5.5%, n = 3), K. pneumoniae (1.7%, n = 1), L. monocytogenes (1.7%, n = 1), and mixed infections of E. coli and K. pneumoniae (5.5%, n = 3). Notably, only 7.2% (14/195) of bacteria were recovered by culture, with S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae (4 each) being the most frequently cultured etiologies, followed by E. coli and S. aureus (2 each). Among K. pneumoniae isolates, 75% (3/4) were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 50% (2/4) to meropenem, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin. One of four (25%) S. pneumoniae isolates showed resistance to erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and rifampin. Overall, 13.8% (27/195) of study participants experienced unfavorable outcomes.

PCR significantly outperformed culture in detecting bacterial pathogens. E. coli was the most common causative agent of bacterial meningitis, and we observed high rates of antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative bacteria."}

Cough is essential to airway defence following aspiration. Using a relevant animal model, we set out to identify the mechanisms by which gastric fluid evokes coughing, the vagal afferents responsible for initiating this reflex and the ion channels directly activated by components of gastric fluid. We studied gastric fluid and citric acid evoked cough reflexes in guinea-pigs and, in parallel, their ability to activate airway vagal afferent nerves. Additionally, we utilized a single cell RT-PCR approach to determine the expression of acid sensitive ion channels by the vagal afferent neurones regulating cough. We observed that gastric fluid evoked coughing following direct application to the tracheal and laryngeal mucosa of anaesthetized guinea-pigs. An acidic pH of the gastric fluid was essential to its ability to evoke coughing, and the tussive actions of gastric fluid were mimicked by citric acid. The vagal afferent nerves regulating cough expressed mRNA for the acid-sensitive ion channels (ASICs) ASIC1, ASIC2 and ASIC3. The coughing evoked by gastric fluid and by acid and the vagal afferent nerve discharge evoked by protons were prevented by the ASIC inhibitors diminazene and diclofenac but not by transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 blockade. Based on these results, we conclude that airway mucosal afferent neuronal ASIC channels are essential to airway defence against aspiration of gastric fluid. We speculate that dysfunction of the reflex pathways initiated by vagal afferent neurone ASIC channel engagement may be a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia in susceptible patients. KEY POINTS: Aspiration of gastric contents can induce an acute lung injury that may progress to life-threatening aspiration pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Cough is an essential defensive reflex that protects the airways from aspiration. Patients with an absent or ineffective cough reflex are at significantly greater risk for developing aspiration pneumonia. Using an animal model, we have determined the potential mechanisms driving cough in response to gastric fluid aspiration. We found that gastric fluid acidity is essential to the initiation of cough and we identified acid-sensing ion channels expressed by vagal sensory nerves terminating in the airway mucosa as key effectors of this reflex."}

To improve 0.55T T2-weighted PROPELLER lung MRI by developing a self-supervised framework for joint reconstruction and denoising. T2-weighted 0.55T lung MRI datasets from 44 patients with prior COVID-19 infection were used. Each PROPELLER blade was split along the readout direction into two disjoint subsets: one subset for training an unrolled network, and the other for loss calculation. Following the Noise2Noise paradigm, this framework split k-space into two subsets with independent, matched noise but identical underlying signal, enabling joint reconstruction and denoising without external training references. For comparison, coil-wise Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MPPCA) denoising followed by parallel imaging reconstruction was performed. The reconstructed images were evaluated by two experienced chest radiologists. The self-supervised model generated lung images with improved clarity, better delineation of parenchymal and airway structures, and maintained high fidelity in cases with available CT references. In addition, the proposed framework also enabled further reduction of scan time by reconstructing images with adequate diagnostic quality from only half the number of blades. The reader study confirmed that the proposed method outperformed MPPCA across all categories (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.001), with moderate inter-reader agreement (weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.55; percentage of exact and within ±1 point agreement = 91%). By leveraging the intrinsic data redundancy in PROPELLER sampling and extending the Noise2Noise concept, the proposed self-supervised framework enabled simultaneous reconstruction and denoising of lung images at 0.55T to address the low-SNR challenge at low-field. It holds great potential for broad use in other low-field MRI applications."}

All patients who completed the ABCC-tool for post-COVID were invited for an online semi-structured interview. We selected post-COVID patients who had used the tool in the past three months. Interviews were audio recorded and analysed using a thematic approach with Atlas.ti version 23. Nineteen post-COVID patients (10 males, mean age 56) were interviewed between May and August 2024. The tool was regarded as user-friendly, and patients indicated they would use the tool again in the future. Patients valued the tool's broad range of topics, some of which are often overlooked in standard healthcare consultations. The tool was comprehensible and relevant according to all patients. The balloon diagram was easy to understand, but a legend explaining the colours of the balloons was preferred.

We aim to use an agent-based model to accurately predict the spread of COVID-19 within multiple US state prisons. We developed a semistochastic transmission model of COVID-19. Five regional state-owned prisons within North Carolina. Several thousand incarcerated individuals. We measured (1) the observed and simulated average daily infection rate of COVID-19 for each prison studied in 30-day intervals, (2) the observed and simulated average daily recovery rate from COVID-19 for each prison studied in 30-day intervals, (3) the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of each prison's summary statistics and the simulated results and (4) the parameter estimates of key predictors used in the model. The COVID-19 pandemic disparately affected incarcerated populations in the USA, with severe morbidity and infection rates across the country. In response, many predictive models were developed to help mitigate risk. However, these models did not feature the systemic factors of prisons, such as vaccination rates, populations and capacities (to determine overcrowding) and design and were not generalisable to other prisons. An agent-based model that used geospatial contact networks and compartmental transmission dynamics was built to create predictive microsimulations that simulated COVID-19 outbreaks within five North Carolinian regional prisons between July 2020 and June 2021. The model used the characteristics of an outbreak's initial case size, a given facility's capacity and its incarcerated vaccination rate as additional parameters alongside traditional susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered transmission dynamics. By fitting the model to each prison's data using approximate Bayesian computation methods, we derived parameter estimates that reasonably modelled real-world results. These individualised estimates were then averaged to produce generalised parameter estimates for North Carolina state prisons overall. Our model had a mean average MAPE score of 23.0 across all facilities, meaning that it reasonably forecasted facilities' average daily positive and recovery rates of COVID-19. Our model estimated an average incarcerated vaccination rate of 54% across all prisons (with a 95% CI of ±0.12).
